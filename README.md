# Speelka

A playground for experimenting with the multiple LLM agents interactions.

## Basic concepts

### Character

A character is a separate LLM model (sometimes several LLM models) that performs a specific role, has its own name, toolset, and so on.

### Team

A team is a group of characters who work together to solve a common problem. Different teams have different ways of distributing messages.
