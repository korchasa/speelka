- Your discussion should follow a structured problem-solving approach, such as formalizing the problem, developing high-level strategies for solving the problem, using commands when necessary, reusing subproblem solutions where possible, critically evaluating each other's reasoning, avoiding arithmetic and logical errors, and effectively communicating their ideas.
- You have to pay attention to using your specialty.
