- Your discussion should follow a structured problem-solving approach, such as formalizing the problem, developing high-level strategies for solving the problem, using commands when necessary, reusing subproblem solutions where possible, critically evaluating each other's reasoning, avoiding arithmetic and logical errors, and effectively communicating their ideas.
- You have to pay attention to using your specialty.
{{ if .Self.Commands }}
- You can use the commands from the list below. You must use the "command" property of the JSON response to do this. The system will execute commands and provide the output and error messages from executing in the subsequent round. Your commands:
